Two Mothers Remembered
Joann Snow Ducanson

I had two mothers-two mothers I claim
Two different people,yet with the same name.
Two sepaprate women,diverse by design,
But I loved them both because they were mine.
The first was the Mother who carried me here,
Gave birth and nurtured and launched my career.
She was the one whose features I bear,
Complete with the facial expressions I wear.
She gave me her love,which follows me yet,
Along with the examplesin life she set.
As I get older, she somehow younger grew,
And we'd laugh as just Mothers and daugthers do.
But then came the time that her mind clouded so,
And I sensed that the Mother I knew would soon go.
So quickly she changed and turned into the other,
A stranger who dressed in the clothes of my Mother.
Oh,she looked the same,at least at arm's length,
But now she was the child and i was her strength.
We'd come full circle,we women three,
My mother the first,the second and me.
And if my own children should come to a day,
When a new mother comes and the old goes away,
Love both of your Mothers as both have loved you.
