Books
Eleanor Farjeon

What worlds of wonder are our books!
As one opens them and look,
New ideas and people rise
In our fancies and our eyes.

The room we sit in melts away,
And we find ourselves at play
With some one who,befoore the end,
May become our chosen friend.

Or sail along the page
To some other land or age.
Here's our body in the chair,
But our mind is over there.

Each book is magic box,
Which with a touch a child unlocks.
In between their outside covers
Books hold all things for their lovers.
