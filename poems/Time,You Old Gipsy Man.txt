Time, You old Gipsy Man
Ralph Hodgson

Time, you old gipsy man,
Will you not stay,
Put your caravan
Just for a day?

All things I'll give you,
Will you be my guest?
Bells for your jennet
Of silver the best,
Goldsmiths shall beat you
A great golden ring,

Peacocks shall bow to you
Little boys sing,
Oh, and sweet girls will
Festoon you with may.
Time,you old gipsy,
Why hasten away?

Last week in Babylon,
Last night in Rome,
Morning,and in the crush
Under Paul's dome;
You tighten your rein-
Only a moment
And off once again;
Off to some city
Now blind in the womb,
Off to another
Ere that's in the tomb.
Time,you old gipsy man,
Will you not stay,
Put up your caravan
Just for a day?
